I am a physicist at [KIT's Institute of Experimental Particle Physics](https://www.etp.kit.edu/english/index.php).
Among others I have contributed to the following open source projects:

* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp): a C/C++ program/library for large language model inference. Mostly contributions to the CUDA code with a focus on reducing hardware costs for consumers.
* [kafe2](https://philfitters.github.io/kafe2/): a Python framework for likelihood-based parameter estimation. Contributions were varied; the most significant one is the fast calculation of the correlated Gaussian likelihood via Cholesky decomposition.
* [fastNLO](https://inspirehep.net/literature/727193): a C++ library for the fast calculation of perturbative quantumchromodynamics cross sections at up to next-to-next-to-leading order via parton distribution function interpolation. I have contributed workflow and performance optimizations as part of my master's thesis.

If you are interested in contributing to llama.cpp but don't know where to start
I will happily answer your questions via Mumble; just send me an email.
